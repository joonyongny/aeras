The "find" feature is your friend.

***OVERVIEW***
Aeras is meant to be light and highly editable, which means it will only provide common funcionalities.
Code sections in template files will be commented to allow easy copy/pasting to control file size.

***GRID***
Aeras provides a responsive 12 column grid system. Gridding is added via classes "col-x" where x is the number of column occupied.
As floated inline-blocks, columns which add up to 12 will occupy the same line.

Columns can be offset by appending "-offest-x" to the class name, where x is the number of columns offset from the left.

***CLICKABLE***
The clickable class provides buttons and links for a fixed sidebar. They change color on hover and click, which can be changed via JQuery.
The CSS for clickable provides for commonalities between all clickables, so it should be included along with more specified code.

*Button*
The button comes as a simple flat, square button with unfixed width and fixed height.

*Link*
The link is a clickable used under the sidebar, with 100% width to fill the width of the sidebar.

***SIDEBAR***
The sidebar is a fixed left side sidebar, with 15% width. Provided JQuery will adjust all elements to avoid overlap if it is used.
